# Comment-Remover
A program that removes comments from programs.

# Process:
First, the program reads from your file of choice.
Then, it checks for comments, and stops writing when it detects one.

Instead of replacing the file, it writes to a new one, so your comments are saved.

# Use cases:
Saving file space on comment heavy projects.
Good for pranks by removing the comments on someone's programs, but still saving their comments.
